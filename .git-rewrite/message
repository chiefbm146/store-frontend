Add browser back button support to Schedule Workshop modal

Integrates Schedule Workshop modal with browser history API to match
the behavior of other modules (About Founder, Contact, etc.).

Changes to smart-message-renderer.js:
- Constructor: Added isModalOpen and currentModalBackdrop state tracking
- Constructor: Added popstate event listener to detect back button
- showFullscreenServiceModal: Pushes #workshop-modal to history on open
- showFallbackModal: Pushes #workshop-modal to history on open
- closeFullscreenModal: Resets state and calls history.back() when needed

Behavior:
- Opening modal: Adds #workshop-modal to browser history
- Back button: Triggers popstate event, closes modal, returns to mobile.html
- Click close: Closes modal and calls history.back() to clean up hash
- Result: Consistent navigation flow across all modules

Fixes issue where Schedule Workshop was the only module that didn't
respond to the back button properly.
